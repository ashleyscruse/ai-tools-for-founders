# AI Tools for Founders and Builders

Open-source AI-powered tools for product validation, ideation, and analysis. Built for founders, solopreneurs, and builders who want to move faster.

These are the same tools I use in my own business and demo at workshops.

## Available Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Product Evaluator** | Brutally honest validation for digital product ideas |
| **Product Idea Generator** | Generates tailored product ideas based on your expertise |
| **Blockchain SaaS Evaluator** | Validates blockchain/web3 product concepts |
| **Whitepaper Analyzer** | Extracts claims, flags risks, summarizes technical docs |
| **Funding Fit Analyzer** | Evaluates startup alignment with funding opportunities |

*More tools added regularly.*

## How to Use

[We'll add installation/usage instructions here once you decide on format — are these prompt files, markdown files, or something else?]

## Why I Build in Public

I'm documenting what actually works (and what doesn't) as I turn my skills into revenue generating ventures, without leaving academia. If you're building on the side too, we're on the same path.
