# AI Tools for Founders

Open-source AI-powered tools for product validation, ideation, and token design. Built for web3 founders, solopreneurs, and builders who want to move faster.

These are the same tools I use in my own business and demo at workshops.

## Available Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Blockchain SaaS Evaluator** | Brutally honest validation for web3 product ideas — including the "do you actually need blockchain?" test |
| **Blockchain SaaS Idea Generator** | Generates tailored web3 product ideas based on your domain knowledge and interests |
| **Tokenomics Starter** | Helps you decide if you need a token, and if yes, designs a simple starting framework |

*More tools added regularly.*

## How to Use

These are Claude Skills — custom instructions that turn Claude into specialized tools. To use them:

1. Download the `.md` file for the skill you want
2. Go to Claude.ai → Settings → Claude Skills
3. Upload the file
4. Start a new conversation and describe what you need

## Why I Build in Public

I'm documenting what actually works (and what doesn't) as I turn skills into revenue generating ventures, without leaving academia. If this resonates, say hi. I like meeting other people figuring this out.
