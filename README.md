# AI Tools for Founders

Open-source AI-powered tools for product validation, ideation, and token design. Built for web3 founders, solopreneurs, and builders who want to move faster.

These are the same tools I use in my own business and demo at workshops.

## How to Use

These are Claude Skills — custom instructions that turn Claude into specialized tools.

**Web or Desktop App:**
1. Download the `.md` file for the skill you want
2. Go to Claude → Settings → Claude Skills
3. Upload the file
4. Start a new conversation and describe what you need

**CLI:**
1. Create a folder with the skill name (e.g., `blockchain-saas-evaluator/`)
2. Rename the file to `SKILL.md` and place it inside the folder
3. Add to your CLI skills directory

## Why I Build in Public

I'm documenting what actually works (and what doesn't) as I turn skills into revenue generating ventures, without leaving academia. If this resonates, say hi. I like meeting other people figuring this out.
