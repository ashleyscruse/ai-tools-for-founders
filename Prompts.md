# Example Prompts

I want to build something in web3 but I'm not sure what. Here's my background:  
\- I understand DeFi pretty well — I've used Uniswap, Aave, and a few yield aggregators daily for about 2 years  
\- I'm frustrated by how hard it is to track my positions across multiple protocols and chains  
\- I'm also interested in DAOs — I've participated in governance for 2-3 projects  
\- My goal is to build something I could launch in 4-6 weeks and potentially charge for  
\- I'm building solo  
What should I build?  

Evaluate this idea:  
I want to build a "Yelp for smart contracts" — a platform where users can rate and review smart contracts they've interacted with. The reviews would be stored on-chain for transparency. Projects with good ratings get a trust badge. I'd charge projects a monthly fee to claim their profile and respond to reviews.  
Is this worth building?  

I'm building a decentralized freelancer marketplace for web3 jobs. Clients post jobs, freelancers bid, work gets done, payment is released from escrow.  
The product works fine with just ETH/USDC payments. But I'm wondering if I should add a token. Maybe for:  
\- Governance (let users vote on platform fees)  
\- Staking (freelancers stake to get featured)  
\- Rewards (token rewards for completing jobs)  
Should I have a token? If so, what should the tokenomics look like?
